The are the files required by [NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page), used to create the Windows setup applications.

* `gnu-mcu-eclipse.nsi` - the script used by makensis to generate the Windows setups;

* `nsis.ico` - the image used in left pane of the setup windows; it was selected because it contains a JTAG reference (saved by Paint, 24-bits, 164 pixels wide by 314 pixels high);

* `nsis.ico` - a generic debugger icon, and not the official OpenOCD icon, since... I could not find such an official icon (48x48).
